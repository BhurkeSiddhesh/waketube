## 2025-05-20 - Missing Context in ARIA Labels
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like Edit/Delete in lists) often lack accessible names, making them indistinguishable for screen reader users when multiple items exist.
**Action:** Always include specific context (like the item's time or name) in the `aria-label` (e.g., "Edit alarm for 7:00 AM" instead of just "Edit").
